## DEPENDENCIES =============================================================================================================
# [please note that executing the below code will install software on your computer]
# [please ensure to have the necessary rights to install software on your computer]

install.packages("renv")
renv::init() # (1) restore the project from the lockfile

install.packages("extrafont")
library(extrafont)
extrafont::font_import()

# install cmdstanr to for model fitting in stan
remotes::install_github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")

# install hBayesDM for model fitting in stan
install.packages("hBayesDM", dependencies = TRUE)

## CLUSTER ==================================================================================================================
# Many of the project scripts contain computationally intensive tasks. To manage the computational load we have executed
# the relevant scripts on a local computing cluster. Fitting the scripts on the cluster is managed via the 'FIT_CLUSTER'
# global parameter. Please note, the present code will not work across clusters and may require substantial modifications.


## CODE STRUCTURE ===========================================================================================================
# run the below scripts in the order they are listed to reproduce the results of the project.

# (1) code/lcid_preprocessing.R
# This script contains all preprocessing steps applied to the raw questionnaire and demographic data.

# (2) code/lcid_parameter_recovery.R
# This script contains all steps to perform the parameter recovery for the hyperbolic model in stan.

# (3) code/lcid_preprocessing_task.R
# This script performs all preprocessing operations on the behavioural task data of the monetary delay discounting task. The
# file returns the object 'dd_task.Rds' which is used in subsequent modeling steps.

# (4) code/modeling.R
# This script fits the hyperbolic delay discounting model in stan using cmdstanr and hBayesDM.

# (5) code/lcid_posterior_predictive.R
# This script contains all steps to examine the posterior predictive checks for the hyperbolic model in stan.

# (6) code/lcid_postprocessing.R
# This script combines outputs from the previous modeling, and processing of data and creates a combined datafile that will
# be used for later analyses and visualisations. The file returns 'tvar_masterdat_wide.csv' and 'tvar_masterdat_long.csv'.

# (7) code/lcid_visualise_results.R
# This comprehensive script contains most visualisations of descriptive statitics, tests, and model results for the present
# project. The script returns a series of plots, some default arguments of which are controlled using the fun_plots.R
# function that contains common theme elements and settings used throughout the plots.

# (8) code/mplus/preprocessing.R
# This script contains all preprocessing steps applied to the raw questionnaire and demographic data for the Mplus analyses.
# Preprocessing the MPLUS data involves getting the data into the format required by MPLUS, removing missing data, and
# determining variables to serve as auxiliary variables for the Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models.

# (9) code/mplus/baseline
# This folder contains the MPLUS scripts and outputs for the baseline models of all mental health indicators.

# (10) code/mplus/moderation_logk
# This folder contains the MPLUS scripts and outputs for all logk moderation models of all mental health indicators.
